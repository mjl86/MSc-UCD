Question 3

(a)
A value of none was returned as well as which was the largest number.
I believe this to be the case as print_max itself doesn't have a value so there is nothing
for the print function in the program to print. When print_max is called in the program by the return syntax it also runs the nested
function which then gives the print_max function its values, but these depend on what the user inputs.


(b)
When the () are left out of the print_max function at the end of the program nothing happens the program doesn't run.
The program doesn't recognise it as print_max() and so doesn't execute. if we do it to print_max in the function we get invalid syntax.


(c)
When the () are put around the print_max function at the end of the program we get a similar response as the last question.
Nothing happens the program doesn't run. The program doesn't recognise it as print_max() and so doesn't execute.
If we do it to print_max in the function we get invalid syntax.
