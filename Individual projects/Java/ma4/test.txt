This is a core module on the MSc Computer Science (Conversion) and Higher Diploma in Computer Science Programmes. 
This module introduces the Java programming language and builds on the Python programming modules taken in trimester of the programme. 
The module will begin with a review of the fundamental constructs of programming, such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, methods etc., and how these contructs are used to write simple programs using Java. 
The module will then focus on the object-oriented programming paradigm. 
Students will learn key object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, enscapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. 
Finally, the module will cover more advanced topics in Java such as exception handling, abstract classes and interfaces, and students will be introduced to larger applications developed using Java. 
A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of practical programming skills.
